# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Genres
- **Genres** sidebar tab: every genre with its track count, a filter box, and
  one click to list its tracks (also exportable as `.m3u`).
- Multi-valued genres: all values in a file are read, legacy joined strings
  are split on configurable separators, and writes use native multi-value
  tags (Vorbis/FLAC, ID3v2.4, MP4). The next scan re-reads every file once.
- Rename, merge, or remove a genre across the whole library — undoable.
- Bulk editor genre modes: replace the list, or add/remove genres while
  keeping each track's others.
- "Select all N tracks" extends a full-page selection to the whole view, so
  bulk edits reach every page.

### Audio quality
- Per-file **spectrogram** in the tag editor, rendered on demand by ffmpeg and
  cached by track + mtime — a lossy transcode dressed up as lossless shows up
  as a hard frequency shelf the codec and bitrate columns can't reveal.
- Click the spectrogram to open it full size in a dismissible lightbox.

### Metadata
- MusicBrainz rate limiting (1 req/s) and retry-with-backoff.
- Edition picker: list the releases a recording appears on and tag from the
  one you actually own.
- Lyrics and compilation tag fields, written per format.

### Library & scanning
- Scan-exclude glob patterns, and an opt-in auto-rescan interval.
- Windowed album grid and lazy-loaded cover art, so large libraries stay
  responsive.
- Empty the trash from Settings.

### UI
- Drag-resizable sidebar and tag-editor panes; widths persist per browser and
  reset on double-click.
- Responsive layout for phones and tablets, visible focus outlines, and a
  keyboard-shortcut help modal on `?`.
- Per-file rename preview in the editor, and a context-aware empty state.

### Operations & hardening
- `GET /api/health` for liveness/version checks, exempt from auth.
- Configurable `TAGGER_LOG_LEVEL`, structured scan-job logging, a JSON 500
  handler, and OpenAPI docs at `/docs`.
- Security: symlink-aware path containment, a cap on cover uploads, UUID
  validation before Cover Art Archive fetches, and FTS query sanitizing.

## 0.2.0

A large feature and hardening release building on the 0.1 proof of concept.

### Metadata & tagging
- Composer and BPM tag fields.
- Discogs as an optional second metadata source (token-gated).
- Tag inference from a file's path/name ("From filename").
- Album flows: auto-number by filename, and find/replace within a tag.
- Case normalization for shouty/lowercase tags.

### Library & files
- Full-library or single-folder rescan, with a concurrent-scan guard.
- File operations: move to a recoverable trash, or reorganize on disk using
  the rename template — both undoable.
- "Keep best quality" de-duplicator on the duplicates panel.
- Audio-quality columns (bitrate / sample rate / channels).
- Undo/redo history for tag edits, bulk edits, renames, removals, deletes,
  and reorganizes.

### Playback, playlists, loudness
- Inline, range-streamed audio playback in the tag editor.
- Export the current view or search as an `.m3u` playlist.
- ReplayGain scanning via `rsgain`/`loudgain`, bundled in the Docker image.

### Access & operations
- Optional single-password authentication with login rate-limiting.
- Live rename-template preview in settings.
- Multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`) images published to GHCR on version tags;
  runs under Docker and Apple's `container` runtime.
- GitHub Actions CI (backend pytest + frontend typecheck/build).
- Test suite covering pure logic, the HTTP API, and real-audio round-trips.

## 0.1.0

Initial proof of concept: browse a library, read/edit tags for FLAC/MP3/
AAC-M4A/OGG, bulk edits, MusicBrainz/AcoustID lookup, cover art, and
template-based rename-on-save.
